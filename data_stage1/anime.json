    "lay": "a creepy ghost appearing, anime style",
    "elaborate": "J-Horror/Supernatural anime style (e.g., *Another* or *Mononoke*). A long-haired, pale-skinned ghost (Onryo) materializes slowly in a dark, empty classroom hallway at night. Camera: Static, wide, high-angle surveillance-style shot. VFX: The ghost is not simply transparent but is rendered with a distinct, shimmering, heat-haze/distortion effect that subtly warps the air around it. Lighting: Single, flickering fluorescent light bulb casting an unsettling, rapid on-off shadow effect. Sound: Subtle, high-pitched ringing/static sound."

    "lay": "anime girl doing a dramatic pose in front of a city",
    "elaborate": "Aesthetic, opening-credits style character pose (e.g., *Monogatari* series). A stylishly dressed, enigmatic girl stands perfectly still on the edge of a skyscraper, silhouetted against a setting sun over a sprawling city. Camera: Extreme Dutch angle (tilted 45 degrees), low camera position, capturing the girl's angular pose and the vast scale of the city. Animation: Minimal movement (only her hair/scarf moves slightly). VFX: Hyper-stylized, abstract, colorful geometric patterns subtly scroll across the screen, overlaid on the shot."

    "lay": "a mech launching from an underwater base, anime style",
    "elaborate": "Underwater/Sci-Fi anime (e.g., *Blue Submarine No. 6*). A massive, sleek combat submersible/mecha launches from the deep-sea hangar of a hidden base. Camera: Slow-motion shot focusing on the transition from the dark, pressure-filled depths to the surface. VFX: Highly detailed, realistic underwater particle effects (bubbles, plankton), complex light refraction/caustics from the surface, and the rapid shedding of water from the mech's body as it breaches the surface. Color: Dark, deep blues transitioning to bright, reflective teal/white."

    "lay": "anime fantasy elf walking through a forest",
    "elaborate": "High-fantasy medieval anime (e.g., *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End*). A stoic, beautiful female elf walks alone through an ancient, mist-covered deciduous forest. Camera: Medium shot, tracking alongside her at a walking pace, with the background elements (trees, ferns) blurring smoothly due to parallax effect. Lighting: Soft, diffused, magical glow from the forest floor and faint god rays breaking through the canopy. Animation: Extremely subtle, fluid movement of her clothes and hair, conveying a sense of timeless grace."

    "lay": "anime school rooftop confession scene",
    "elaborate": "Climactic 'Confession' scene in a romantic comedy anime (e.g., *Kaguya-sama: Love Is War*). Two high-school students stand awkwardly on a brightly-lit school rooftop at sunset. Camera: Rapid, high-cut-count sequence of close-ups on their trembling hands, their feet (shuffle), and their intense, expressive eyes. VFX: The background is washed out to a single, vibrant, emotional gradient (saturated orange and pink), focusing all attention on the characters' highly detailed, internal facial expressions. Sound: Emphasis on heavy breathing and heartbeats (simulated POV audio)."
